LE DICE ROLLER
This is a programming project I started in November 2011 in computing class/DCT because that's what I had to do.

Anyways, it can do stuff like calculate dice rolls, save preset numbers, and save a text file with the results. It's
written in the language of Visual Basic.NET, and I have yet to upload the updated version, and build that updated 
version under the MONO framework.

It basically consists of a random number function, a streamwriter function, and heavy usage of the My.Settings
namespace.
